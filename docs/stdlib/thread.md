# trusty:thread

Status: Planned.

## Goal

This module is part of the TRUST stdlib roadmap and is not implemented yet.

## Planned Scope

- Public API matching TRUST syntax with strong typing.
- Zero-runtime-overhead wrappers where possible.
- Predictable error behavior without forcing unwrap in user code.

## Proposed Import

`import { ... } from "trusty:thread";`

## Notes

- This page is a spec placeholder.
- Update this document with concrete API tables and examples when implementation starts.
